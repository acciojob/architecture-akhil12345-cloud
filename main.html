			  <p style="text-align:center;">An architect is a person who plans, designs, and oversees the construction of buildings.[1] To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose.[2] Etymologically, the term architect derives from the Latin architectus,[3] which derives from the Greek[4] (arkhi-, chief + tekton, builder), i.e., chief builder.[5]

The professional requirements for architects vary from location to location. An architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus the architect must undergo specialised training consisting of advanced education[6] and a practicum (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction though the formal study of architecture in academic institutions has played a pivotal role in the development of the profession.</p>
